# wingflow_grasshoppers
Matlab code for analyzing particle trajectories from fluoresecent data set. 

Code doesn't have a particular structure, but does sort particles into a normalized wing region and into the five wing regions listed in the paper: leading edge, membrane, lattice, wing tip, trailing edge.
